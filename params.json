For **Windows** users   `C:\\Windows\\System32\\Drivers\\etc\\hosts`\r\n2. This opens a system file that contains the following line: --\r\n```127.0.0.1    localhost```\r\n3. On the next line, type `127.0.0.0` followed by a space and the name of the virtual host you want to create for example `mysite.dev` as new line will be`127.0.0.1    mysite.dev`\r\n4. Save the file when you have finished adding the names of your virtual hosts.\r\n5. Now open the main Apache configuration file, `httpd.conf`, which is located at `Applications/MAMP/conf/apache/httpd.conf` in **MAC** or `C:\\wamp\\bin\\apache\\Apache2.2.11\\conf\\httpd.conf` in **Windows**.\r\n6. Now search following line --\r\n`# Include /Applications/MAMP/conf/apache/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf`\r\n7. Remove the hash (`#`) sign from the beginning of the line that begins with `Include`.\r\n8. Save the file, and then open `Applications/MAMP/conf/apache/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf`. This is where you define the virtual hosts\r\n9. At the bottom of the page are two examples of how to define virtual hosts in Apache. Now Update the files with below code.\r\n```php\r\n<VirtualHost *:80>\r\n    DocumentRoot \"/Applications/MAMP/htdocs\"\r\n    ServerName localhost\r\n</VirtualHost>\r\n<VirtualHost *:80>\r\n    DocumentRoot \"/Applications/MAMP/htdocs/mysite\"\r\n    ServerName mysite.dev\r\n</VirtualHost>\r\n```\r\nSave all the files you have edited, and restart the servers in the MAMP control panel. You should now be able to access the virtual host with the following URL: http://mysite.dev/\r\n\r\n**Note:-** If you want to create more than one virtual host, copy one of the definitions, and edit it accordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
